# Falling-Blocks
A game where the user dodges falling stuff. Big blocks do a lot of damage, but they're slower, small blocks do a half as much damage but they're faster.  Survive as long as you can and use the powerup drops to your advantage!

# Instructions
Run the *falling_blocks.py* file if you are not on a mac and *falling_blocks_mac.py* otherwise. Control the character with the arrow keys. The objective is to dodge the falling objects and survive as long as you can to increase your score.

Replace the rel_path variables in the game script with your directory path so the images can be properly imported.
